# ðŸ›’ Sales Forecasting for Grocery Retailers Using Random Forest (Python)

This repository contains a sales forecasting project for my *Programming in Python for Business Analytics* module. The project builds a forecasting model for a South American grocery retailer to address the challenge of over- and under-stocking perishable goods across 54 stores and 33 product types.

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Predict daily sales for each product in each store for the period of **July 31 â€“ August 15, 2017** using machine learning (Random Forest Regressor).
